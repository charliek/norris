# This is an example configuration that could be used. Move it to

# Below are the default values. You only need to override the

[config]
# The url to fetch. This url should have one joke per line. This
# can also be a file url if you want to avoid network IO. (e.g.
# "url = file:///Users/cknudsen/projects/norris/norris.txt" )
url = http://charliek.github.com/norris/norris.txt

# The timeout in seconds to use when fetching the url before failing
timeout = .5

# Should the program print something when if fails
