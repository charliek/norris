Overview
--------

This is a program will print out Chuck Norris jokes, or other types of
jokes/quotes/sayings if you put together an alternative file. If you do
put together an alternative file see the example_config.txt file for
directions on how to enable it.

This program has been tested on the mac platform, but it will most likely
run on any system with Python 2.6 installed. If not file a bug or send a
pull request.

Install
-------

Check out the code and put the norris.py file somewhere in your path. You
are free to rename the file "norris" or anything you want. Or instead create
a symlink so it is easier to pick up updates.

Things you can do
-----------------

1. If you put this file on your path and name it "norris" you can then add
   it to your ~/.bash_profile and have it print out a joke every time a
   console opens.

2. If you pipe the output to the "say" command your computer will tell you
   the joke, and you will most likely laugh.

   norris | say

3. You should tell me more ways to enjoy this.
